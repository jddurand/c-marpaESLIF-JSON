# Marpa::R2 Updates

## About this page

This is the updates page for Marpa::R2.
This page carries information which does not justify
a full new distribution,
but which it is useful for the user to know.

On CPAN, Marpa::R2's primary distribution mechanism,
there is no way to have true "meta" information --
even a small doc always is part of the distribution itself
and requires the creation of a completely new version.

Because Marpa is now "stable", new versions are released only
when they benefit its current users.
In effect, this means new versions occur only when a serious
bug is discovered, which (knock on wood)
happens rarely.
